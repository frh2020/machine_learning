Many of these codes can be replaced by high level frameworks like Keras and Estimator. But it's still a good practice to use basic python codes to build models and data pipelines for beginners to understand the basic of neuron networks.

each folder holds python programs in jupyter notebooks, and are named by the topics.

1. neural networks and deep learning

2. improving deep neural networks

3. structuring machine learning projects

4. convolutional neural networks

5. sequence models

More uploads are coming.
